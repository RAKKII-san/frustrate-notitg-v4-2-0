Recently, I've felt like I can't seem to have workable ideas in the hobbies I do, like charting, mod writing, and drawing
Things feel like they don't work out because I feel my imagination is stagnant
Makes me feel like I'm running in circles going nowhere

You could say I feel FRUSTRATED in art, haha

This modfile is dedicated to anyone who's also stuck in art block like I was in the first half of 2022
